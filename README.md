# Airbnb-Analytics-Project
Airbnb Analytics Project using Snowflake + dbt, including seeds, staging, DIM/FCT modelling, cleaning, testing, and snapshots, plus integration of external full-moon data.
This project demonstrates an end-to-end Airbnb analytics pipeline using Snowflake as the cloud data warehouse and dbt as the transformation and modeling framework;

It covers a full modern data lifecycle:
Loading raw Airbnb datasets (Listings, Hosts, Reviews) into Snowflake
Building seeds, staging models, cleaned tables, dimensions, facts, and snapshots
Incorporating external full-moon calendar data to analyze booking patterns during full-moon periods
Implementing tests, documentation, and data quality checks
Producing a clean, analytics-ready semantic layer optimized for BI dashboards and downstream analysis
